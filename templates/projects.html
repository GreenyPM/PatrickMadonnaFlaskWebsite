    This was a Project made in Unity using C# and the Unity Libraries to make a Mouse and Keyboard controlled Robotic Vtuber Model.
    I live streamed with this as my avatar for about 2 years and the project had revisions and additions to the code every time I streamed.
    This was how I built my foundations of Object Oriented Programming. <b>you can watch some of the videos utilizing it by clicking on the project name.</b>

    A Personal PokÃ©mon Card Creator, the user answers a series of quiz questions and then is told what their Pokemon type is based on their answers. 
    Then the user is prompted to pose for a photo to have it taken, so with the use of a card printer the user is able to print their own custom pokemon card. 
    These make for great gifts for fans of pokemon or just fans of the card game. <b>If you'd like to know more click on the title to got to the GitHub repo.</b>

    A Comic-Book, Videogame, and, Anime Gameshow made in Python. This was hosted on stage infront of a live audience durring the SUNY Canton Comic-Con for 2023 and 2024.
    I brought up students to the stage to test their trivia, shilhoette recogntion, videogame skills, and, sound recognition. I'm interested in continuing the show if 
    enough people are interested and given the right venue. <br>

    This is just a game that I made for a friend after we had just gotten done talking about eggs and how they are pretty cool.
    keep in mind this game was finished 4 weeks after. When I showed them the game they said "Wow, I can't believe you actually did it!".

    I made this Game Dictionary Application over the Winter Break of 2023. I made this in a day and utilized the Pandas library to transfer the data directly into an Excel document. 
    This application focuses on dictionary manipulation in Python. It utilizes the basic ideas of Databases using a pk or Primary Key to prevent the script from overwriting the values of
     keys in the dictionary. I plan to re-use ideas of this code later to work with a MySQL database and Django. This is a proof of concept to better establish my interest and skills in 
     data manipulation and software development.

    This at its base is a GUI prompt-entry application utilizing the ChatGPT Dall-E API.
    The conversion process in the code is quite complex as the image has to be converted from a JSON file to a JPG.
